# acerolajam2024
This is the source code of my submission for the 2024 Acerola Jam, a 2-week game jam held through late February into March.  MY game feathures arcade-survival gameplay paired with a skill tree progession system.  The game lacks some visual design/polish; this would be my focus given more time.  The project is written in GML (GameMaker Language).
